# Apriori-Algorithm
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Apriori algorithm, a popular algorithm used in data mining and association rule learning. The Apriori algorithm is widely utilized for discovering interesting relationships hidden in large datasets, particularly in market basket analysis.

## Features:
- Efficient Apriori Implementation: The code provides a scalable and efficient implementation of the Apriori algorithm to mine frequent itemsets from transactional datasets.

- Flexible Parameters: Easily customize parameters such as support threshold to suit your specific dataset and requirements.

- Association Rule Generation: In addition to mining frequent itemsets, the implementation supports the generation of association rules, allowing you to uncover meaningful associations between different items.

Example Datasets: The Groceries Market Basket Dataset contains 9835 transactions by customers shopping for groceries. The data contains 169 unique items.

## Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the provided examples or integrate the Apriori algorithm into your own projects.
Feel free to explore, contribute, and adapt the code for your data mining projects. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy mining!
